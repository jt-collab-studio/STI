# Mobile App Development with .NET MAUI

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is the process of developing a software.

## 5 Phases of Mobile SDLC
1. **Inception:** All apps start with an idea. That idea is usually refined into a solid basis for an application.
2. **Design:** The design phase consists of defining the app's User Experience (UX), such as what the general layout is, how it works, etc., as well as turning the UX into a proper User Interface (UI) design.
3. **Development:** Usually the most resource-intensive phase, this is the actual building of the application.
4. **Stabilization:** When development is far enough, Quality Assurance (QA) usually begins testing the application and bugs are fixed. Often, an application will go into a limited beta phase in which a wider user audience is given a chance to use it, provide feedback, and inform changes.
5. **Deployment:** In this phase, applications and updates are delivered from developers to users.

## .NET MAUI
- **.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI)** is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. .NET MAUI allows you to develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.
