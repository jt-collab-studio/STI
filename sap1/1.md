## SAP S/4HANA
- It is the next-generation Business Suite and the biggest innovation since SAP R/3.
- It is the digital core of the company that enables digital transformation.
- One of the advantages of SAP S/4HANA is real-time simplification. A typical booking transaction with 15 tables
could be compressed to four (4) tables using SAP S/4HANA.

## SAP Fiori
- It is a design system and a user experience (UX) layer that allows business app creation with a consumer-grade
user experience. It makes casual users into SAP experts with simple screens that run on any device. SAP Fiori
provides a user interface for SAP S/4HANA.
- It has three (3) application types:
  - **Transactional apps** that are used to access tasks like Create, Change, or Display Process with
guided navigation;
  - **Analytical apps** that give a visual overview of business data and
  - A **factsheet** with a view of the essential information about objects and contextual navigation
between related objects.

## Data Types
- **Organizational Data** are data that are part of the organizational unit,such as the company code, plant, storage location, and distribution channel.
- **Master Data** such as person, material, customer, and vendor can be stored for a long time and rarely changed. It represents logically grouped data like customer master, material master, vendor master, and general ledger accounts.
- **Transaction Data** is the system record of the business event wherein, depending on the business event, different master data and organization data will be referenced.
- For example, during a sales order business event, the following data is stored:
  - Organizational: Client, Company Code, Sales organization
  - Master: Customer, Material, Pricing
  - Transaction: Date, Time, Person, Amount

## Cloud vs. On-Premise
- **SAP S/4HANA** can be accessed on the **Cloud** and **On-Premise**.
- The **Cloud Edition** has a subscription licensing deployed in the private cloud maintained by SAP. SAP also provides system and control maintenance.
- The **On-Premise edition** is under traditional licensing with customer control of deployment and maintenance.
