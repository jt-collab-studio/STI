## SAP S/4HANA
- It is the next-generation Business Suite and the biggest innovation since SAP R/3.
It is the digital core of the company that enables digital transformation.
One of the advantages of SAP S/4HANA is real-time simplification. A typical booking transaction with 15 tables
could be compressed to four (4) tables using SAP S/4HANA. It is achieved since the S/4HANA Data Model
Principles allow data storage in denormalized form, have a single data source, remove redundant data storage
for tasks such as aggregation, and process aggregation and analytics on the fly. It is compared to the traditional
database architecture, which frequently uses redundant data to increase data aggregation performance and
requires more effort to update redundant data.
